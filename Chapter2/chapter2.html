            <br><br>
<p>
General Advice: Various <em>standard C/C++</em>  functions exist that may be used
when solving exercises.
</p><p>
For such (standard) functions, the following simple rules apply:
    </p><ul>
    <li> If an exercise explicitly tells you to use a particular function,
        that function must (of course) be used to complete the exercise.
<p>
</p></li><li> For several tasks standard functions are available. Starting next
        week we'll be able to define our own functions. When standard
        functions exist you should <em>not</em> develop comparable functions
        yourself. Don't reinvent the wheel. Visit our <a href="https://www.icce.rug.nl/edu/1/manpages">manpages</a> overview
        for an overview and description of functions that are useful for this
        course (now or at some future moment in time).
    </li></ul>
<p>
Some suggestions:
    </p><ul>
    <li> String-operations should be performed using <code>std::string</code>
objects; 
<p>
</p></li><li> Functions whose names start with <em>is...()</em>, should be used to find
the category a certain character value belongs to. E.g., letters, digits,
punctuation marks, white space (example: <code>is_space</code>);
<p>
</p></li><li> For <em>input and output</em> <code>iostream</code> objects must be used. For
now, use <code>cin</code> for input, and <code>cout</code> for output. Do <em>not</em> use the
<strong>C</strong>-functions <code>printf, scanf</code> or their relatives.
    </li></ul>
<p>
To find out which (standard) functions exist, consult books, or use
on-line manuals. On <em>Unix</em> systems you can use the man-pages or the
info-reader. Other systems offer comparable documentation sources. Many
man-pages are available at the course's restricted section: <a href="https://www.icce.rug.nl/edu/1/manpages">manpages</a>. If
a function is not mentioned there, it's unlikely that you need it for this
course.
</p><p>
Experience shows that all reference information is already available on
your computer; buying reference books therefore is something of the past.
Very good references can also be found on-line (e.g.,
<a href="http://en.cppreference.com/w/">cppreference</a>). Sooner or later you 
develop a mental picture of available functions, and you only occasionally
have to refer to their man-pages.
</p><p>
Be careful not to develop a brain-dead searching habit. Don't
go to these references before you've studied the subject matter. <em>First</em>
study the Annotations, <em>then</em> resort to references, if necessary.
</p><p>
The more up-to-date your mental picture is, the better and faster you can
develop programs, as you will be able to use existing software, developed and
debugged by others (be)for(e) you.  This philosophy is present in <strong>C++</strong> even
stronger than in <strong>C</strong>, so get used to it quickly.
</p><p>
</p><ul>
    <li> In programs developed during this part of the course, erroneous
<em>input</em> need not be considered, unless the exercise explicitly asks you to
do so. So, if a program expects a number, your code does not have to check
for numeric input.
<p>
We know the position we take here is dangerous, as <em>many</em> sources of
errors in programs result from unchecked input and arguments. Although
programs <em>should</em> rigorously check their input, doing so in the
realm of our exercises often hides the actual purpose of the exercises.  Hence
we ordinarily do without, knowing that error handling is covered later
in this course.
</p><p>
</p></li><li> Programs that solve the exercises are usually fairly small. If
you think a lot of code is required to solve a particular exercise, <em>think
again</em>: you're probably doing something wrong.
<p>
</p></li><li> When writing programs reading text files you may assume that the last
line is properly terminated by a newline character, unless explicitly
indicated otherwise.
<p>
</p></li><li> Often we use objects from the so-called standard namespace (e.g.,
<code>std::cout</code>, <code>std::string</code>). If your source files contain a line
        <pre>
    using namespace std;
        
</pre>

    just before the actual source code starts, then the <code>std::</code> prefixes may
be <em>omitted</em> when referring to entities from that namespace. 
    </li></ul>

        <strong>Exercise 9.</strong>
        <br>
        Basic exercise
        <br>
        Purpose of this exercise: create a program producing a multiplication table
<p>
Remember primary school? You had to learn by heart the multiplication
tables. In this little program we're going to do that again, but differently.
</p><p>
Design a program that is called from the command-line with one argument: a
numeric positive integral value for which the program should display the
multiplication table. 
</p><p>
You may assume that the argument that's passed to the program is indeed a
positive integral value.
</p><p>
For example, starting the program as <code>a.out 7</code> must produce:
    </p><pre>
    1 * 7 = 7
    2 * 7 = 14
    3 * 7 = 21
    4 * 7 = 28
    5 * 7 = 35
    6 * 7 = 42
    7 * 7 = 49
    8 * 7 = 56
    9 * 7 = 63
    10 * 7 = 70
    
</pre>

<p>
Hints: make sure you localize. Also, avoid IRE.
</p><p>

        <strong>Exercise 10.</strong>
        <br>
        Basic exercise
        <br>
        Purpose of this exercise (letters): learn to determine sets of characters
<p>
(Extended) ascii characters fit in bytes (having 8 bits). In the header file
<code>ctype.h</code> characters can be inspected for all kinds of characteristics
(e.g., using functions like <code>isspace</code> to test whether a character is a space
character) (cf. <strong>isspace</strong>(3)). 
</p><p>
Not assuming anything about the ordering or position of letters in the ascii
character set, fill a <code>std::string</code> with all letters found in the ascii
character set.
</p><p>
Submit your program and the the program's output, showing the constructed
string containing all letters.
</p><p>
Hint: letters consist of lowercase and uppercase characters, but a dedicated
function is available testing whether a character is either a lowercase or an 
uppercase character.
</p><p>
<br><br>
    
</p><hr>
        <strong>Exercise 11.</strong>
        <br>
        Basic exercise
        <br>
            Purpose of this exercise: contrast a correct way to read a file with an
incorrect way.
<p>
Create a simple program displaying the number of lines it reads from its
standard input. If the command-line argument <code>ok</code> is provided it should use
the correct (standard) form for reading files. 
</p><p>
If the command line argument <code>ok</code> is not provided, it should prematurely
test whether lines were successfully read (consequently, it will print a
value which is one too large). 
</p><p>
The program can easily be tested by entering a couple of lines using your
keyboard, terminating the input using ctrl-D.
</p><p>
Note: the correct form <em>must</em> use an eternal loop, the incorrect form
<em>must</em> use a form in which <code>EOF</code> is tested before (instead of after)
reading the file.
</p><p>
<br><br>
    
</p><hr>
        <strong>Exercise 12.</strong>
        <br>
        Basic exercise
        <br>
        Purpose of this exercise: learn to perform some string-manipulations
<p>
Define a word as series of non-blank characters. Write a program that reads
lines of text from <code>cin</code> and for each line in turn it replaces the line's
first word by the line's last word, and then writes the line to
<code>cout</code>. 
</p><p>
Note that lines may contain no, one, two or more words.
</p><p>
<br><br>
    
</p><hr>
        <strong>Exercise 13.</strong>
        <br>
        Basic exercise
        <br>
        Purpose of this exercise: introduce and learn to write a simple filter.
<p>
A <em>filter</em> is a program reading its information from the standard input,
writing its output to the standard output. Many filters exist, e.g.,
<strong>sed</strong>(1), <strong>cat</strong>(1), <strong>(g)awk</strong>(1), <strong>gpg</strong>(1), to name a few.
</p><p>
In this exercise develop a filter that removes empty lines existing at the
beginning of <code>cin</code> and at the end of <code>cin</code>. A line is not empty if it
contains at least one non-blank character.  If an empty line contains blank
characters then those characters can be ignored when writing that empty line
to the standard output stream.
</p><p>
The venom of this exercise is (literally) in its tail: how do you know whether
a bunch of empty lines are indeed at the end? 
</p><p>
Caveats: we <em>haven't</em> covered arrays of undetermined sizes yet, so you can't
store lines in an array, and you're <em>not</em> supposed to adopt the
Perl approach, where you first read in the full file, and then process
what you've got. Using a <code>std::string</code> variable is OK, but that variable may
never contain more than one line read from the standard input.
</p><p>
<br><br>
    
</p><p>
</p><hr>
        <strong>Exercise 14.</strong>
        <br>
        Advanced exercise
        <br>
        Purpose of this exercise: learn to apply a standard type in a non-standard
way.
<p>
Design a program showing all combinations of all the program's command
line arguments (not using the program name itself). Each combination should be
displayed on a numbered line. The first line should be empty (none of the
arguments are shown), the last one should show all the program's arguments.
</p><p>
Hints: 
    </p><ul>
    <li> this exercise is extremely simple: think about how values are stored
        in the bits of an integral-typed variable like an <code>int</code>.
    </li><li> Localize as much as possible.
    </li><li> Be aware of IRE!
    </li><li> In case you're tempted: floating point values are nowhere necessary.
    </li><li> A bit premature: to skip the program name do <code>++argv</code>
            as 1st statement in <code>main</code>.
    </li></ul>
<p>
Example:
        </p><pre>
    a.out if then else
    1: 
    2: if 
    3: then 
    4: if then 
    5: else 
    6: if else 
    7: then else 
    8: if then else 
        
</pre>

        <strong>Exercise 15.</strong>
        <br>
        Advanced exercise
        <br>
            Purpose of this exercise: learn how to use bit-manipulations.
<p>
<strong>C++</strong> has a shift-left (<code>&lt;&lt;</code>) and a shift-right (<code>&gt;&gt;</code>)
operator. Many processor instruction sets (and some computer languages) also
support <em>rotate</em> instructions: <code>ror</code>, rotate right, makes sure that the
least significant bit `dropping off' to the right will be re-inserted to the
left, <code>rol</code>, rotate left, makes sure that the most significant bit dropping
off to the left will be re-inserted to the right. So, with a 4-bit binary
value 0101 a <code>ror</code> results in the value 1010. Construct a program <code>rotate</code>
expecting the following arguments:
        </p><ul>
        <li> An integral value, represented as a binary value, using only 0
and 1 characters, e.g., 011010. 
        </li><li> the word <code>rol</code> (rotate left) or <code>ror</code> (rotate right). 
        </li></ul>
    Use the number of characters of the provided value and apply the required
rotation (so, 00111 is a 5-bit value). Show the new value in binary, decimal
and hexadecimal form. For example <code>rotate 00111 ror</code> should results in:
    <div style="text-align: center"><code>10011 19 13</code></div>
        Additional requirements/hints:
        <ul>
        <li> Use a <code>size_t value</code> to store the binary value in.
        </li><li> Use a <code>size_t newValue</code> to store the rotated value in.
        </li><li> <code>newValue</code> must be given its proper (rotated) value when it's
defined. So <em>no</em> further assignments to <code>newValue</code> are allowed (Hint: use
a conditional assignment and bit-wise operators).
        </li><li> Parentheses may only be used when absolutely necessary.
        </li></ul>
    Submit the program <code>rotate.cc</code> as well as the results of:
        <pre>
    rotate 1011110101011011 ror
    rotate 1101111101110111 rol
        
</pre>

        <strong>Exercise 16.</strong>
        <br>
        Advanced exercise
        <br>
        Purpose of this exercise: learn to think about inserting values
<p>
It looks so easy: inserting a value into <code>cout</code> using the octal, decimal or
hexadecimal number system. But can you do it yourself?
</p><p>
This exercise focueses on inserting numbers in a certain number system.
</p><p>
Number systems beyond 9 use letters for representing values. Let's allow all
number systems from binary to a number system using base (radix) 36: 10 digits
plus 26 (lower case) letters.
</p><p>
Write a program that expects two (decimal) non-negative integral numbers on
the command line. The first one is the radix to use when displaying the second
number.
</p><p>
Examples:
        </p><pre>
    $ number 5 34
    34, displayed using radix 5 is: 114
    $ number 21 34
    34, displayed using radix 21 is: 1d
    $ number 16 57005
    57005, displayed using radix 16 is: dead
    $ number 30 0
    0, displayed using radix 30 is: 0
        
</pre>

<p>
Hints and caveats:
    </p><ul>
    <li> For those who have previous programming experience: no functions!
    </li><li> To determine the <em>last</em> digit of a <code>value</code> in a number system
        using <code>radix</code> compute <code>value % radix</code>. The last but one digit uses
        the same computation, but then on the value <code>value / radix</code>.
    </li><li> Make sure your program also works when converting the value 0. Other
        than that, leading zeros should be ignored.
    </li></ul>
