## Exercise 5

- '>' is called redirection

- '|' is called piping

The main difference between the two is that the piping operator places stan-
dard output of a program into the standard input of another program.  Take for
an example the ’wc’ (word count) tool of linux.
The redirection operator places files into the standard input of a program, or
places standard output of a program into a file.
So, one is for program interaction, the other is for file interaction.


$ program < in > out

This example inputs a file called ’in’ into the program and puts the output of
the program into a file called ’out’.


$ program | less

This example puts the output of the program in the command less.  With the
less command you can read the output of the program page by page.
